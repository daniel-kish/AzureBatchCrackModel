# AzureBatchCrackModel

## About
This project is roughly 60% of my bachelor's thesis.
Here I use Microsoft Azure Batch service for parallel processing of a certain rupture mechanics simulations (elaborated [here](https://github.com/daniel-kish/CrackModel)). Main thing here is cloud apps, so-called cloud assemblies - ZIP archives that consist of certain dlls that implement the behaviour of a batch service that is to be deployed in the cloud at a great scale. You can read more about batch processing with Azure Batch [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/).
